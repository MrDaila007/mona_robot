Launch description for the simulation infrastructure (World).

This module initializes the Gazebo physics engine and the Foxglove
telemetry bridge. It serves as the foundational infrastructure required
prior to the instantiation of any robotic agents. No robot-specific
nodes or namespaces are declared within this scope.

    # CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL NOTE: Late Joiner QoS Mitigation for Foxglove
    # ==============================================================================
    # The Foxglove bridge is deliberately wrapped in a TimerAction to delay its execution.
    #
    # Rationale: Our C++ IPC component container initializes the robot's hardware
    # interfaces and TF tree extremely fast (in milliseconds). The `/tf_static` topic,
    # which contains the robot's structural frames, relies on the `Transient Local`
    # QoS policy.
    #
    # If the Foxglove bridge is launched simultaneously with the robot spawn inside
    # a Dockerized FastDDS network, a known Race Condition occurs during topology
    # discovery. The bridge drops the initial `/tf_static` broadcast, causing the
    # Foxglove Studio UI to cache an empty TF tree ("No options" in Fixed Frame)
    # and fail to sync with `/clock`.
    #
    # By delaying the bridge by 7 seconds, we guarantee it joins the ROS 2 graph
    # ONLY after the network topology is fully stabilized and latched topics are
    # populated, ensuring a flawless telemetry sync.
