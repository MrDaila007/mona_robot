# Testing and Validation Guide

> **Continuous Verification**
> 
> System reliability in the MONA architecture is guaranteed through a rigorous, multi-layered testing pipeline. This guide outlines how to execute tests locally, understand the CI pipeline, and write new unit tests for C++ and Python components.

## 1. Automated CI Pipeline (Local Testing)

Before opening a Pull Request, every developer is required to run the local Continuous Integration script. This script acts as a gatekeeper, running all static analyzers and unit tests within the isolated Docker environment.

**Execution:**
```bash
# Attach to the development container
docker compose up -d dev
docker compose exec dev bash

# Execute the local CI pipeline
./scripts/local_ci.bash
```

> [!NOTE]
> This script automatically executes colcon test, evaluates linter compliance, and prints a summary of any failed test cases.

## 2. C++ Unit Testing (GTest / Ament)

All C++ nodes and libraries must be covered by Google Test (`gtest`).

### Core Testing Patterns

Due to the safety-critical nature of MONA, we enforce testing of ROS 2 Node Lifecycles. Every component must have an instantiation test to ensure it handles memory correctly during initialization and shutdown.

**Example: Lifecycle Instantiation Test (`test_lifecycle_instantiation.cpp`)** This test verifies that a Managed Node can be successfully instantiated and destroyed without memory leaks or segfaults.
```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp>
#include "mona_safety/safety_node.hpp"

TEST(SafetyNodeTest, Instantiation) {
  rclcpp::init(0, nullptr);
  rclcpp::NodeOptions options;
  auto node = std::make_shared<mona_safety::SafetyNode>(options);
  
  EXPECT_EQ(node->get_name(), std::string("safety_node"));
  rclcpp::shutdown();
}
```

### Running Specific C++ Tests

To run tests for a single package and view the console output (useful for debugging):
```bash
colcon test --packages-select mona_safety --event-handlers console_direct+
```

---

## 3. Python Testing (Pytest)

Python modules, particularly the `fdir_manager.py`, utilize the standard `pytest` framework integrated with `ament_python`.

To execute tests specifically for Python core utilities:
```bash
colcon test --packages-select mona_core --pytest-args -v
```

---

## 4. Static Analysis and Linters

MONA adheres strictly to ROS 2 style guidelines. Linters are automatically executed during the `colcon test` phase.
- **ament_uncrustify:** Enforces C++ formatting rules (configured via `configs/uncrustify.cfg`).
- **ament_cppcheck:** Detects undefined behavior, memory leaks, and uninitialized variables in C++.
- **ament_flake8:** Enforces PEP 8 compliance for all Python scripts.

If `uncrustify` fails, you can automatically format your C++ code by running:
```bash
ament_uncrustify --reformat src/
```

---

## 5. Code Coverage (Codecov)

The GitHub Actions CI pipeline is configured to compile the workspace with the `-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage` GCC flags. Test coverage reports are automatically uploaded to Codecov on every Pull Request. Reviewers will block PRs that significantly drop the overall test coverage percentage.
